**Bash aliases** 
I never like typing long commands, especially the git ones since I used git extensively throughout my day.

So, I make an alias for any command which seems to be long enough for me. It makes the life a lot easier. To try it, copy paste
the contents into a file called **.bash_aliases**(You can name the file whatever) and load it into the current bash session by typing the following.
> source .bash_aliases (assuming you are into the same directory as .bash_aliases)

Short forms of the commands that you can use alongwith its explanation.

> gs => git status

> gd => git diff

> gc => git commit -m

> gp => git push

> gpull => git pull

> gcheckout => git checkout

> add_to_path => to add a file to the environment


**Many more aliases will be added. Stay tuned**
